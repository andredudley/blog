# Welcome to Dev.ADJ!

This blog is being made as a fun pet project. From logging my progress, to showing fun little projects I made, to yapping into the abyss as I lose my absolute marbles... I'd say my blog has it all, yeah?

You can check out the source code if you'd like. 
Maybe you can find some use of it in your own projects. 
I think that would be awesome, in all honesty.

Anywho, have a look and have a ball!
