        <h2>Who Is ADJ?</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Andre Dudley Jr.&mdash;the ADJ in question. I am the creator of the Dev.ADJ website.
           When I graduated from Albany State University with a Computer Science degree, I had to ask myself the age-old question:
        </p>
        
       
        <p class="question-asked"><i>Now what?</i></p>
        
        <p>
            A question, to be brutally honest, I was in no shape to even think about answering. 
            The past two years, before I had even begun to think about making this website, had been brutal. 
            And, as a result, I had little projects to show for my four years of education.
            I could code&mdash;at least I though I could&mdash;but I never really knew what to do with what I learned.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were a few concepts and ideas I had in mind, but nothing really stuck. 
            And, in the wake of my own mental health crisis that I had gone through, an idea bloomed.
            Having remembered the occasional heartache&mdash;and headaches&mdash;that I have endured through my own journey of learning web development,
            I came up with the idea of cataloging my own learning journey. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to log my own learning and growth as a way to show people (and my future self) that if I can do it, you <strong>DEFINITELY</strong> can.
            So, if I am able to help even <strong style="font-style: italic">ONE</strong> person in a concept that I used to struggle in, I'd consider the existence of this website to be a massive success.
            Or, if one of my yap sessions about my hobbies ends up making your day, my day will be made too.
        </p>
        <p class="signoff">I love each and every one of you, 
            <br>
